<h1>Among us</h1>
<h2>Among Us is a 2018 online multiplayer social deduction game developed and published by American game studio Innersloth.
     The game allows for cross-platform play; it was released on iOS and Android devices in June 2018 and on Windows later 
     that year in November.</h2> 
<h2>Among Us takes place in space-themed settings where players are colorful, armless cartoon astronauts. Each player
     takes on one of two roles: most are Crewmates, but a small number are Impostors. Crewmates work to complete assigned
      tasks in the game while identifying and voting out suspected Impostors (who appear identical to Crewmates) using social
       deduction, while Impostors have the objective of killing the Crewmates. </h2>
  <h2>Among Us size for download on PC is 250MB of HD space.</h2>
