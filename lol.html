<h2>League of Legends (LoL), commonly referred to as League, is a 2009 multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by Riot Games.
     Inspired by Defense of the Ancients, a custom map for Warcraft III, Riot's founders sought to develop a stand-alone game in the same genre.
      Since its release in October 2009, League has been free-to-play and is monetized through purchasable character customization. The game is available
       for Microsoft Windows and macOS.</h2>
       <h2>In the game, two teams of five players battle in player-versus-player combat, each team occupying and defending their half of the map.
         Each of the ten players controls a character, known as a "champion", with unique abilities and differing styles of play. During a match,
          champions become more powerful by collecting experience points, earning gold, and purchasing items to defeat the opposing team.
           In League's main mode, Summoner's Rift, a team wins by pushing through to the enemy base and destroying their "Nexus", a large structure
            located within.</h2>
            <h2>League of Legends needs roughly 20.6 GB of hard disk space, and the initial file that needs to be downloaded is approximately 68 MB. </h2>
