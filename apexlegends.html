<h2> Apex Legends is a free-to-play battle royale-hero shooter game developed by Respawn Entertainment and published by Electronic Arts.
     It was released for PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One in February 2019, for Nintendo Switch in March 2021, and for PlayStation 5
      and Xbox Series X/S in March 2022.</h2>
      <h2>Apex Legends is an online multiplayer battle royale game featuring squads of three players using pre-made characters with distinctive
         abilities, called "Legends", similar to those of hero shooters. Alternate modes have been introduced allowing for single and for two-player
          squads since the game's release. The game is free-to-play and monetized through microtransactions and loot boxes, which allow the
           player to spend both real money and in-game currency on cosmetic items, such as outfits for the Legends and new colors for weapons.</h2> 
           <h2>For PC gamers using Windows, Apex Legends will take up approximately 53 GB of your storage, and mobile players it will take 3.9 GB.</h2>
