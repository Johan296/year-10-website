<h2>Call of Duty: Warzone was a free-to-play battle royale video game developed by Raven Software and Infinity Ward and published by Activision.
     The game was released on March 10, 2020, for PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One as a part of 2019's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and was
      subsequently connected to 2020's Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War and 2021's Call of Duty: Vanguard, but did not require purchase of any of
       the aforementioned titles. Warzone allowed online multiplayer combat among 150 players and featured both cross-platform play and cross-platform
        progression between the three aforementioned titles.</h2>
        <h2>At launch, the game featured two main game modes: Battle Royale and Plunder. Warzone introduced a new in-game currency system that could be used
             at "Buy Stations" in and around the map. "Loadout Drops" were a key in-game object allowing players to access and switch between their customized
              classes and were obtainable through purchase with the Cash currency. Players could also use Cash to purchase items such as "killstreaks" and gas masks.
               Cash could be found by looting buildings and killing players that had cash on them. At launch, Warzone only offered Trios, a squad capacity of three players;
                Solos, Duos and Quads were eventually added to the game via post-launch updates.</h2>
                <h2>The current download size for Warzone on Windows is approximately 175GB.</h2>
