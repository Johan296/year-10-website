<h2>Minecraft is a 2011 sandbox game developed by Mojang Studios and originally released in 2009. The game was created by Markus "Notch" Persson in the Java programming language.
     Following several early private testing versions, it was first made public in May 2009 before being fully released on November 18, 2011, with Notch stepping down and Jens 
     "Jeb" Bergensten taking over development. Minecraft has become the best-selling video game in history, with over 300 million copies sold and nearly 140 million monthly active
      players as of 2023. It has been ported to several platforms.</h2>
      <h2>The Minecraft download size for PC is just 1GB of HD space.
        Of course, the game will take up significantly more room than 1GB if you plan on installing one of the many Minecraft mods or mod packages that are readily available,
         and expand on the base game immensely.</h2>
