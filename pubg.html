<h1>PUBG</h1>
<h2>PUBG: Battlegrounds is a battle royale game developed by PUBG Studios and published by Krafton. The game, which was inspired
    by the Japanese film Battle Royale, is based on previous mods created by Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene for other games, and 
    expanded into a standalone game under Greene's creative direction.</h2>
    <h2>It was first released for Windows via Steam's early access beta program in March 2017, with a full release in December 2017.
         The game was also released by Microsoft Studios for the Xbox One via its Xbox Game Preview program that same month, and 
         officially released in September 2018. PUBG Mobile, a free-to-play mobile game version for Android and iOS, was released in
          2018, in addition to a port for the PlayStation 4. A version for the Stadia streaming platform was released in April 2020,
           with Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 versions being released in November 2020. The game has been free-to-play for all 
           platforms since January 12, 2022.</h2>
